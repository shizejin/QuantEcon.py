"""
This module contains functions that generate NormalFormGame instances of
the 2-player games studied by Fearnley, Igwe, and Savani (2015):

* Colonel Blotto Games (`blotto_game`)

* Ranking Games (`ranking_game`)

* SGC Games (`sgc_game`): These games were introduced by Sandholm,
  Gilpin, and Conitzer (2005) as a worst case scenario for support
  enumeration as it has a unique equilibrium where each player uses half
  of his actions in his support.

* Tournament Games (`tournament_game`)

* Unit vector Games (`unit_vector_game`)

def sgc_game(k):
    """
    Return a NormalFormGame instance of the 2-player game introduced by
    Sandholm, Gilpin, and Conitzer (2005), which has a unique Nash
    equilibrium, where each player plays half of the actions with
    positive probabilities. Payoffs are normalized so that the minimum
    and the maximum payoffs are 0 and 1, respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    k : scalar(int)
        Positive integer determining the number of actions. The returned
        game will have `4*k-1` actions for each player.

    Returns
    -------
    g : NormalFormGame

    --------
    >>> g = sgc_game(2)
