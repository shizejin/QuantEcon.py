"""
This module contains functions that generate NormalFormGame instances of
the 2-player games studied by Fearnley, Igwe, and Savani (2015):

* Colonel Blotto Games (`blotto_game`): A non-zero sum extension of the
  Blotto game as studied by Hortala-Vallve and Llorente-Saguer (2012),
  where opposing parties have asymmetric and heterogeneous battlefield
  valuations.

* Ranking Games (`ranking_game`): These games were introduced by Goldberg,
  Goldberg, Krysta, and Ventre (2013) because of (i) they are important
  and well-motivated games by Economics literature and (ii) their
  computational complexity.

* SGC Games (`sgc_game`): These games were introduced by Sandholm,
  Gilpin, and Conitzer (2005) as a worst case scenario for support
  enumeration as it has a unique equilibrium where each player uses half
  of his actions in his support.

* Tournament Games (`tournament_game`)

* Unit vector Games (`unit_vector_game`)

    Return a NormalFormGame instance of a 2-player non-zero sum Colonel
    Blotto game (Hortala-Vallve and Llorente-Saguer, 2012), where the
    players have an equal number `T` of troops to assign to `h` hills
    (so that the number of actions for each player is equal to
    (T+h-1) choose (h-1) = (T+h-1)!/(T!*(h-1)!)). Each player has a
    value for each hill that he receives if he assigns strictly more
    troops to the hill than his opponent (ties are broken uniformly at
    random), where the values are drawn from a multivariate normal
    distribution with covariance `rho`. Each playerâ€™s payoff is the sum
    of the values of the hills won by that player.

    Parameters
    ----------
    h : scalar(int)
        Number of hills.
    T : scalar(int)

        Random seed (integer) or np.random.RandomState instance to set
        the initial state of the random number generator for
